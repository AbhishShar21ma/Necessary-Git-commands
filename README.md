#Purpose

This is the new git repository which I have created in not by using git hub website but only by terminal using git init command.

So as i called git init command it will start intializing git in the new folder and will create a new repository

but this inside file README.md still not tracked and not pushed so will do it by using different commands

Using git status command will show me the information of all tracked and unktracked files.

now after doing this we will start adding the new file using git add "file name".

For pushing this fil on github we will do "git remote add origin and then ssh address"

now for checking this was pushed or not we will run git remote -v command and it will show me the details of pushing
